<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen, <br><br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer. <br><br>
        You can find more information about <a href="https://www.university-dates.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i>  study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around <br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.
    </p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably <br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> modem styles such as Twerking.</blockquote>
    <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br> because they were really cold.</p>
    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://www.exotic-pages.com">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
